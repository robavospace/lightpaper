**Abstract**: 

In African countries, there are many benefits to accessing space:

Space-based imagery can be used for mapping and land management. This is especially useful in Africa, where the landscape is constantly changing due to natural disasters and development.

Satellites can be used to improve communication within Africa and with other parts of the world. They can also be used to monitor weather patterns, predict natural disasters, and better prepare for them.

Lastly, access to space can boost a country's economy by creating new jobs in the aerospace industry. Robavo Space is committed to making this a reality for Africa. We have the ambition and technical expertise required to improve the affordability and accessibility of space for African countries.

# Introduction

Robavo Space is committed to developing the infrastructure necessary for African countries to participate in the global space economy, advance their socioeconomic development goals, develop homegrown technologies, and collaborate with international partners.

The benefits of space exploration are vast, including technological advances, economic opportunities, increased knowledge about our planet and universe, and national and regional security advantages. However, many people don’t realize that developing countries can also reap these benefits by exploring space. In fact, African countries can benefit from many applications for satellite imagery and other data collected from orbit. 

That’s why Robavo Space is working hard to develop the infrastructure necessary for African countries to participate in the global space economy. This includes building partnerships with international organizations to share knowledge that will help African countries leapfrog the developmental stages for their homegrown technologies.

By doing this, African countries can take advantage of everything that the global space economy has to offer while advancing their own socioeconomic development goals. We believe that this is essential for Africa’s future growth and prosperity.


**What is driving this effort?**

Recently, Africa has experienced a recent surge of activity in the space industry as many countries begin to explore and utilize space-derived services and products. Further, [the African Union has identified space science and technology](https://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/37434-doc-au_space_strategy_isbn-electronic.pdf) as a key area of focus for developing the continent, which can improve the quality of life for all Africans.


**Why is now a great time?**

There are many reasons why now is a great time to develop the African space industry: 

**Rapid growth and expansion:** The African space industry is growing rapidly. In 2021, African countries budgeted $548.6 million for their space programs, which was a 9% increase from their 2020 budget.

**Diverse range of specializations:** The African space industry generated $7.37 billion in revenue in 2019 and is expected to generate more than $10 billion by 2024.

**A young and vibrant sector:**  114 new satellite projects are currently under development in 20 African countries, which suggests that there is significant potential for growth in this sector.

These investments present a huge opportunity for indigenous African companies to become leaders in this rapidly-growing industry.

**Some benefits of investing in space science and technology:**

Satellites can be used for mapping and surveying purposes, which is essential for land management and infrastructure planning.

Satellites can be used to improve communication networks throughout the continent, which will boost economic growth and bridge the digital divide between rural and urban areas.

Satellites can monitor environmental conditions (such as deforestation rates and air quality), which can help governments develop effective policies to promote sustainable development.

Satellites equipped with sensors that measure various environmental parameters (such as wind speed and humidity levels) can provide valuable information about impending disasters (such as droughts, floods, and landslides), which can help emergency responders plan evacuation routes and deliver aid supplies effectively.

Satellites can be used for agricultural monitoring, to help farmers improve crop yields and make better decisions about when to plant crops and how much water they need for irrigation.

Regional satellite navigation systems can help people navigate their way around Africa more easily and precisely.

## Problem

Africa has a rich history of space exploration dating back to the early 1960s, when NASA built one of their Deep Space Network stations in Hartebeesthoek, South Africa. However, due to a lack of infrastructure and funding, Africa's space programs have been hampered by slow progress.


**Current Space Infrastructure**

Presently, Africa does not have the ability to launch spacecraft or satellites into orbit on its own; it also lacks the bandwidth required for large-scale spacecraft design and development. South Africa and Egypt are two notable exceptions, which can locally design and build satellites and subsystems. Other African countries still rely upon China or other European countries for help with spacecraft design, while Russia, China, or America provides launch services.


**Current Space Funding**

Unquestionably, the greatest obstacle for most African space startups is financing. Private investors are hesitant to invest in African space startups because they see it as an unproven market with uncertain returns. The lack of government grants or funding also hampers growth within the industry.

### Solution

As African countries continue to explore and utilize space-derived services and products, it's important that they also develop their capabilities to access and use outer space. Robavo Space is leading the way in this area.

**Why is this important?**

There are many reasons why African countries should develop their own space programs:

**Economic Development:** Access to outer space offers opportunities for economic development through satellite communications, earth observation, mining resources, tourism, and other activities.

**Capacity Building:** Developing indigenous capabilities in aerospace engineering and related disciplines helps to build human capital that can be used for other areas of economic growth and social development. It also strengthens institutions by creating new centers of excellence within universities and research institutes across Africa.

### Concerns

Although space exploration is vitally important for human advancement, many people believe that it should be reserved for developed countries that have the resources they need to build and launch their own satellites and rockets. Admittedly, the cost of space exploration is high.  Nevertheless, we believe that everyone has a right to explore space and that the potential benefits of these initiatives are enormous. By exploring and utilizing space products and services, developing countries can improve their economic conditions and catalyze positive social change.

Opponents also cite the lack of technical expertise in developing nations. Again, this argument fails to consider the potential benefits of space exploration. For example, training programs in aerospace engineering can help students develop essential skill sets that are transferable to other industries, such as aviation, defense, and electric vehicles. In addition, partnerships between developed and developing nations can help people and companies share technology and knowledge, which ultimately helps both parties.

### Why does Africa need Robavo Space?

The African continent is home to more than 1.2 billion people, making it the second most populous continent in the world. Nevertheless, there are very few space-related programs and initiatives on the continent. Robavo Space is changing that by promoting socio-economic development in Africa through space science and technology and by building relationships among the space and educational sectors in Africa, the U.S., and beyond.

We will achieve this goal by inspiring young Africans of all backgrounds to fall in love with space through relevant educational and training opportunities. We plan to do this through the Robavo Space Academy and the Robavo Space Fellowship, which will offer scholarships and internship opportunities in aerospace engineering and related fields at our facilities across Africa. We hope that through the Robavo Space Academy and the Robavo Space Fellowship, we can give all African students the financial and professional resources they need to pursue careers in space science or technology.

## Founding Team

Robavo Space was started in 2021 as a side project by Alexander. Alexander is passionate about using space technology to improve the lives of people on Earth.


**What will differentiate the Robavo Space Team?**

TThe history of space exploration has been marked by many successes and failures. Ultimately, three factors separate successful projects from unsuccessful ones: leadership, funding, and technology. However, we believe that an additional factor is often overlooked: people and culture.

At Robavo Space, we pride ourselves on being a company with innovative people who have a drive to push boundaries. We also believe that having a positive attitude towards work and life sets us apart from other companies in this industry. It allows us not only to survive, but to thrive during challenging times. For example, SpaceX, NASA, and Blue Origin are all in the business of space exploration. However, what differentiates SpaceX from NASA or SpaceX from Blue Origin is the people and culture.

At Robavo Space, we firmly believe that it's not just about having a good idea, but having the right people behind it. Our company culture is based on three core values: innovation, teamwork, and respect. We strive to create an environment in which everyone feels comfortable enough to share their ideas, no matter how crazy they may seem, because we know that's how progress is made. And respect for others isn't just lip service; it's something that we live by every day. We're always respectful of our clients' time, resources, and opinions. After all, this is their project, too.
