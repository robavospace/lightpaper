# Introduction

In Africa, spacefaring ambitions are socio-economic development goals. Robavo Space is working to develop the infrastructure necessary for African countries to participate in the global space economy and advance their social and economic development goals by developing homegrown technologies and collaborating with international partners.

The benefits of space exploration are vast, including technological advances, increased knowledge about our planet and universe, economic opportunities, national and regional security advantages and more. However, many people don’t realize that these benefits extend to developing countries as well. In fact, advancements in technology from previous space missions have helped improve medical treatments (artificial limbs, cardiac implants, baby formula), increase crop yields, provide access to clean water sources, and more importantly create jobs locally.

That’s why Robavo Space is working hard to develop the infrastructure necessary for African countries to participate in the global space economy. This includes building partnerships with international organizations to share knowledge and technology transfer initiatives that will help African countries leapfrog developmental stages while developing homegrown technologies. 

By doing this, African countries can take advantage of all that the global space economy has to offer while advancing their own social and economic development goals at the same time. We believe that this is essential for Africa’s future growth and prosperity.


**What is driving this effort?**

Africa has seen a recent surge in space industry activity, with many countries beginning to explore and utilize space-derived services and products because the African Union has identified space science and technology as a key area of focus for developing the continent. This is an important step, as space science and technology can help Africa to leapfrog developmental challenges and improve the quality of life for all Africans.


**Why is now a great time?**

There are many reasons why now is a great time for the African space industry. Here are three key reasons:

- **Rapid growth and expansion**– The Africa space industry is growing rapidly. In 2021, African countries budgeted $548.6 million for their space programs, which was a 9% increase from their 2020 budget.

- **Diverse range of specializations** – The Africa space industry generated $7.37 billion in revenue in 2019 and is expected to generate more than $10 billion by 2024. 

- **Young and vibrant sector** – 114 new satellite projects are currently under development by 20 African countries, which suggests that there is significant potential for growth in this sector.

This presents a huge opportunity for indigenous African companies to emerge and become leaders in this rapidly-growing industry.

## Problem

Africa has a rich history of space exploration dating back to the early 1960s when NASA built one of their Deep Space Network stations in Hartebeesthoek, South Africa. However, due to a lack of infrastructure and funding, Africa's space programs have been hampered by slow progress.


**Current Space Infrastructure**

Presently, Africa does not have the ability to launch spacecraft or satellites into orbit on its own and lacks the bandwidth required for large-scale spacecraft design and development. South Africa and Egypt are two exceptions; they can locally design and build satellites and subsystems. Most African countries still rely upon China or other countries in Europe for help with spacecraft design while Russia, China, or America provide launch services.


**Current Space Funding**

There is no question that a lack of accessible financing options is holding African space startups back. Private investors are hesitant to invest in African space startups because they see it as an unproven market with uncertain returns. The lack of government grants or funding also hampers growth within the industry.

***

### Solution

As countries in Africa continue to explore and utilize space-derived services and products, it's important that they also develop their capabilities to access and use outer space. Robavo Space is leading the way in this area, with its commitment to developing African space capabilities.

**Why is this important?**

There are many reasons why African countries should develop their own space programs: 

- Economic Development: Access to outer space offers opportunities for economic development through satellite communications, earth observation, mining resources, tourism and other activities.  

- Capacity Building: Developing indigenous capabilities in aerospace engineering and related disciplines helps build human capital that can be used for other areas of economic growth and social development. It also strengthens institutions by creating new centers of excellence within universities and research institutes across Africa.

### Concern

There is no doubt that space exploration is important for human advancement. However, many people believe that space exploration should only be reserved for developed countries with the resources to do so. We disagree. We believe that everyone has a right to explore space, and that space can play an important role in socio-economic development for developing countries.

One of the main reasons why people argue against space exploration for developing countries is because it is expensive. However, this argument fails to take into account the potential benefits of space exploration. By exploring and utilizing space products and services, African nations can improve their economic conditions and bring about positive social change .

Another common argument against space exploration for developing countries is that these nations lack the necessary technical expertise. Again, this argument fails to take into account all of the potential benefits of space exploration. For example, training programs in aerospace engineering can help develop essential skillsets that are transferable to other industries, such as aviation, defense, electric vehicles, and automotive. In addition, partnerships between developed and developing nations can help share technology and knowledge, which ultimately helps improve both parties involved.

### Why Africa needs Robavo Space?

One of our primary goals is to promote socio-economic development in Africa through the use of space technology. There are many applications for satellite imagery and other data collected from orbit, and we believe that African countries can benefit greatly from these resources. Some benefits of investing in space science and technology include:

- Satellites can be used for mapping and surveying purposes, which is essential for land management and infrastructure planning.

- Satellites can be used to improve communication networks throughout the continent, thus helping to boost economic growth rates and bridging the digital divide between rural and urban areas. 

- Satellites can assist in monitoring environmental conditions (such as deforestation rates, air quality, etc) which can help policymakers develop effective policies aimed at promoting sustainable development.

- Satellites equipped with sensors that measure various environmental parameters (such as wind speed, humidity levels, etc.) can provide valuable information about impending disasters (such as drought, floods and landslide), which can help emergency responders plan evacuation routes or deliver aid supplies effectively.

- Satellites can help farmers improve crop yields through agricultural monitoring (monitor crops and track weather patterns, which can help farmers make better decisions about when to plant crops and how much water they need for irrigation.)

- Regional satellite navigation systems can help people navigate their way around Africa more easily and precisely.


Robavo Space also believes in promoting education and training opportunities for Africans interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We plan to do this through Robavo Space Academy and Robavo Space Fellowship, which will offer scholarships as well as internship opportunities in aerospace engineering at our facilities across  Africa. We hope that through education and exposure to real-world applications of STEM skillsets, more Africans will be inspired to pursue careers in these fields. This will ultimately lead to greater innovation on the continent, which is desperately needed if Africa is going to catch up with developed nations.

### How does Robavo Space help?

Robavo Space is leading the way, building space products and services that will enable Africa to achieve its spacefaring ambitions. We’re committed to making this possible through partnerships with African universities, governments, businesses and other organizations interested in space exploration and utilization for the benefit of all Africans.

### Design Principles

Our design and development philosophy is focused on iterative design and development. We design fast, build fast, test fast, learn fast, iterate fast. These principles reflect the problems inherent in the current process of building space products and services today. Hence, we are prioritizing speed, cheaper cost, performance, reliability, and security. Our team has a strong belief that these principles will enable us to create better products and services in a shorter amount of time while maintaining quality.

## Founding Team

Robavo Space was founded in 2022 as a side project by two engineers. Both founders are passionate about using space technology to improve the lives of people on Earth.

**What will differentiate Robavo Space Team?**

The history of space exploration has been marked by many successes as well as failures. What separates successful projects from unsuccessful ones is often attributed to three factors: leadership, funding, and technology. But we would like to suggest an additional factor that is often overlooked: people and culture. 

At Robavo Space we pride ourselves on being a company with innovative people who have a drive to push boundaries. We also believe that having a positive attitude towards work and life sets us apart from other companies in this industry – it allows us not only survive but thrive during challenging times. For example, SpaceX, NASA, and Blue Origin are all in the business of space exploration. However, what differentiates SpaceX from NASA or SpaceX from Blue Origin is the people and culture. 

At Robavo Space we firmly believe that it's not just about having a good idea but also having the right people behind it. Our company culture is based on three core values: innovation, teamwork, and respect. We strive to create an environment where everyone can feel comfortable sharing their ideas – no matter how crazy they may seem – because we know that's how progress is made. And respect for others isn't just lip service; it's something we live by every day. We're always respectful of our clients' time, resources, and opinions; after all, this is their project too.
